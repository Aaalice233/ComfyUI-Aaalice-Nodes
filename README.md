# ComfyUI-Aaalice-Nodes

Compact parameter controls and workflow utilities for ComfyUI.

> This package is a published preview. Workflows and behavior may change before the first stable release, and the package does not migrate data from ComfyUI-Danbooru-Gallery.

## Requirements

- A current ComfyUI installation with V3 custom-node support.
- Classic canvas or Nodes 2.0. App Mode is not currently supported.
- English and Simplified Chinese UI are included; other locales fall back to English.

## Installation

### ComfyUI Manager (recommended)

1. Open **ComfyUI Manager** and go to the custom-node management page.
2. Search for `ComfyUI-Aaalice-Nodes` or the Registry package id `comfyui-aaalice-nodes`.
3. Select **Install**, then restart ComfyUI and refresh the browser.

Manager installs the published [`comfyui-aaalice-nodes`](https://registry.comfy.org/nodes/comfyui-aaalice-nodes) package and its declared dependencies. Use Manager for normal installation and updates.

### Manual Git installation

Use Git when you need the latest development revision or a specific commit. Clone the repository into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`, install dependencies with the Python environment used by ComfyUI, and restart:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/Aaalice233/ComfyUI-Aaalice-Nodes.git
cd ComfyUI-Aaalice-Nodes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Updating and troubleshooting

- Registry installations should be updated through ComfyUI Manager.
- Manual Git installations can be updated with `git pull` from this repository directory.
- Restart ComfyUI after Python updates and hard-refresh the browser after frontend updates.
- If an existing node keeps an old socket or widget structure after a structural update, remove that node instance and create it again.

## Included nodes

| Node | Category | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ParameterPanel` | `Aaalice/control` | Manage one parameter set and expose up to 32 direct outputs. |
| `ParameterReceiver` | `Aaalice/control` | Bind a ParameterPanel and collect its KJ Get values behind one compact output surface. |
| `SimpleStringSplit` | `Aaalice/tools` | Split text by comma or pipe, trim whitespace, and remove empty parts. |

## Using ParameterPanel

New panels contain `Steps`, `CFG`, `Sampler`, `Scheduler`, `Denoise`, and `Seed`. Sampler and scheduler options follow the current ComfyUI installation.

- Change values directly on the node.
- Right-click the node and choose **⚙️ Edit Parameters…** to add, rename, reorder, copy, delete, or document parameters.
- Connect each visible output directly to the matching downstream input. Links stay with the same parameter when it is renamed or reordered.
- Seed supports fixed, increment, decrement, and randomize behavior. The inline lock button switches between fixed and randomize for quick use.
- If KJ Set/Get is installed, **🔗 Create and link KJ Set nodes for all parameters** is available from the node menu.

Deleting a connected parameter requires confirmation because its links must be removed. A panel can contain at most 32 value-producing parameters; separators do not consume outputs.

## Using ParameterReceiver

`ParameterReceiver` requires KJNodes Set/Get support for binding and synchronization. Create the receiver in the same graph as its source panel, then right-click it and choose **🔗 Bind Parameter Panel…**.

- The first bind reuses existing KJ Set nodes and asks before creating missing ones. Matching collapsed Get nodes are arranged to the receiver's left.
- Parameter renames and panel-title changes refresh labels automatically. Adding, deleting, or reordering parameters changes the footer to **Needs sync**; use **🔄 Sync from Parameter Panel** to apply structural changes.
- **🎯 Locate Parameter Panel** centers the bound source. **✂️ Detach** removes receiver-only managed Gets after confirming affected links.
- If the source panel is deleted, the receiver keeps its saved slot and link snapshot and reports **Source panel missing**. It can then be explicitly rebound.

KJNodes is optional for the package as a whole. Without it, ParameterReceiver workflows still load, but bind and sync report an error instead of simulating routing.

## SimpleStringSplit

Enter text and choose `,` or `|` as the delimiter. The node trims each segment, removes empty segments, and returns the remaining strings as a list.

## Compatibility and limitations

- This preview has no compatibility layer for workflows created with the legacy package.
- App Mode is not supported.
- Structural frontend updates can require recreating existing node instances after refresh.
- ParameterReceiver only binds a ParameterPanel in the current graph; it does not search inside subgraphs.

Keep [ComfyUI-Danbooru-Gallery](https://github.com/Aaalice233/ComfyUI-Danbooru-Gallery) installed separately if you still need its original nodes.
